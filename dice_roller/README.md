# Dice Roller Game

A simple Python program that rolls pairs of dice. This is my first project.

# Features

-- Rolls pairs of six-sided dice
-- Displays the count of dice pairs rolled
-- Clean, formatted output showing both dice in each pair

#How it works

This program:
1) Asks if you want to play(you should answer y/n else the error will occur)
2) Lets you choose how many dice pairs to roll
3) Displays the pairs with a running count
4) Displays an error if you chose wrong letter

# Example Output

Do you wanna play?(y/n): y
How many dice do you wanna roll?: 2
(3, 5)
Number of dice rolled: 1
(1, 6)
Number of dice rolled: 2

# Requirements
